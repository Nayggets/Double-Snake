# Double-Snake

This game, created using C++ with SDL, is similar to Snake, but it involves two players competing on the field. The objective is to eliminate the other player to win.

## History 
The game was made to understand Game Engine basic mechansim and driver also to understand graphic library like SDL.
We also undertook this project to practice working as a team.
